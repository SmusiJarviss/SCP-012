## Features

- The room will automatically spawn in LczToilets, where a new door will be created.
- Players will be attracted to the Bad Composition with a configurable force.
- Players who approach will begin to experience configurable effects.
- The distance at which the Bad Composition acts is configurable. [Not recommended, as it may attract players outside the room]
- Players who get too close to the Bad Composition will be compelled to complete it, while repeating configurable phrases, and   ultimately, they will die from exsanguination.
